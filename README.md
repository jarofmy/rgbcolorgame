# rgbcolorgame

This RGB Color Game was created utilizing HTML5/CSS/JavaScript & jQuery.

A randomized RGB color code will be displayed at the top of the game.

Six different, individually colored circles will be presented to the user.

The objective is to click on the colored-circle that corresponds to the given RGB color code at the top of the window.

If an incorrect color is chosen, the circle will disappear.

Once the correct color is picked, every other circle will change to match the correct color.

The user may have the option to restart a new game at any given time.

The user may also choose the "easy" difficulty settings, where only 3 separate colored-circles will be preseneted.
